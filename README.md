Toxic comments are harmful online remarks that are disrespectful, 
abusive, or unreasonable, often discouraging users from participating in 
discussions. Using Deep Learning techniques, the project focuses on classifying 
comments as either "toxic" or "non-toxic." It employs a hybrid model 
combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural 
Networks (RNNs) to achieve this. Using Deep Learning techniques, the project focuses on classifying
